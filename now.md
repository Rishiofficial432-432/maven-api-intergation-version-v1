# Maven: A Deep Dive into Your Intelligent Workspace

This document provides a comprehensive, top-to-bottom explanation of the Maven application. It covers the core philosophy, the application's features, and detailed walkthroughs of each workflow, from creating a simple note to managing a classroom.

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Your Data, Your Device

Before diving into the features, it's essential to understand what makes Maven different. It is a **local-first** and **privacy-first** application.

-   **What this means for you:** All your information—every note, task, journal entry, and setting—is stored directly on your computer's hard drive, within your web browser's secure storage. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly use an AI feature (which sends only that specific request to Google's servers) or the Google Workspace integration.
-   **The benefits:** You have absolute ownership and privacy. The app works perfectly offline, and there are no accounts or sign-ups required.

## 2. The Main Interface: Your Three Control Panels

When you launch Maven, the interface is divided into three distinct vertical sections, designed for a clear and organized workflow.

1.  **The Left Sidebar (Navigation):** This is how you move between the major sections of the app. You can switch between your **Notes**, the main **Dashboard**, your private **Journal**, the **DocuMind** visualizer, and other modules. When in the "Notes" view, this sidebar also lists all your created notes for quick access.

2.  **The Center Content Area (Your Workspace):** This is the largest section and is where you do your work. It's where you'll write in the editor, interact with your dashboard widgets, or build a mind map.

3.  **The Right Sidebar (The AI Assistant):** This is your intelligent command center. You can chat with the AI in plain English to control almost every aspect of the app, making it the fastest way to get things done.

## 3. Feature & Workflow Explanations

Here is a detailed breakdown of each feature and its typical workflow, illustrated with examples.

### The Notes Workflow

This is your space for focused writing and knowledge management.

-   **Creating a Note:** You click the "New Page" button in the Left Sidebar. A new, empty note immediately appears in the Center Content Area, ready for you to start typing.
-   **Writing and Formatting:** The editor works like any modern word processor. You can write your thoughts, and for more advanced formatting, you can press **`Cmd+K`** (or `Ctrl+K`). This opens a command palette where you can select options like "Bold," "Heading 1," or "Bulleted List" to structure your document.
-   **Personalizing with Banners:** At the top of any note, you'll see an "Add Banner" button. Clicking this allows you to upload an image or video from your computer, giving each note a unique visual identity.
-   **AI-Powered Editing:** While editing, you can highlight a block of text, press **`Cmd+K`**, and choose an AI action. For example, selecting "Summarize" will instantly replace the selected text with a concise summary generated by the AI.

### The Dashboard: Your Daily Command Center

The Dashboard is a collection of powerful widgets. You can switch between them using the navigation in the Left Sidebar when the Dashboard view is active.

#### **AI Brain Dump Workflow**

This is for turning chaotic thoughts into organized actions.

*   **Example Scenario:** You have a rush of thoughts: *"need to email sarah about the report deadline tomorrow at 10am, also remember to buy milk, and I had a great idea for a new podcast about the history of space exploration."*
*   **Your Action:** You open the AI Brain Dump widget and type or paste that entire, unstructured sentence into the text box. You then click "Process with AI".
*   **The Result:** The AI analyzes your text and presents a structured, categorized list of suggestions:
    *   An **Event**: "Email Sarah about report deadline" for tomorrow's date at 10:00 AM.
    *   A **Task**: "Buy milk".
    *   A **New Note Idea**: A note titled "Podcast about history of space exploration" with some initial brainstorming points as content.
*   **Finalizing:** You see checkboxes next to each suggestion. You can uncheck any you don't want. Once you're happy, you click "Save Selected Items". Instantly, the event is added to your Calendar, the task appears in your Task List, and a new note is created in your Notes view.

#### **Attendance Manager Workflow (for Educators)**

This is a complete system for managing classroom attendance.

*   **Step 1: Setup:** A teacher, "Dr. Reed," navigates to the Attendance widget. She creates a new class called "History 101". She can then either add students one-by-one (e.g., Name: "Alex Johnson", Enrollment ID: "S201") or use the "Import" button to upload an Excel file containing her entire class roster.
*   **Step 2: Starting a Session:** It's the start of class. Dr. Reed selects "History 101". She sees a toggle for "Location-Aware" attendance. She enables it. This is a security feature to ensure students are physically present. When she clicks **"Start New Session"**, the app captures her current GPS location and generates a unique 6-digit **One-Time Password (OTP)**.
*   **Step 3: Student Check-in:** A student, "Alex," logs into his Student Portal on his own device. He sees a simple input field. Dr. Reed announces the code, "123456". Alex types it in and clicks "Check In".
*   **Step 4: Automatic Verification:** The system verifies the OTP. Because this is a location-aware session, the app then **mandatorily requests Alex's location** via his device's GPS. The system checks if he is within the radius set by Dr. Reed (e.g., 100 meters). If he is, he is marked "Present". If he denies location access or is too far away, the check-in will fail, even with the correct OTP.
*   **Step 5: Live View and Reporting:** On Dr. Reed's screen, Alex's name immediately appears in the "Live Attendance" list. After the session, this record is saved permanently. At any time, Dr. Reed can view past attendance records or click "Export" to download a complete attendance sheet for "History 101" as an Excel file.

#### **Other Dashboard Widgets**

-   **Tasks:** A straightforward to-do list. You type your task and press Enter. Click the checkbox to mark it complete.
-   **Kanban Board:** A visual project board. You can add a card like "Design Mockups" to the "To Do" column, then later drag and drop it to "In Progress" and finally to "Done".
-   **Calendar:** A traditional calendar where you can add and view events for each day.
-   **Pomodoro Timer:** A focus timer to help you work in 25-minute intervals.
-   **Habit Tracker:** Add habits like "Read for 15 minutes". Each day you complete it, you mark it off and build your streak.

### The Journal Workflow

This is your private space for daily reflection.

-   **How it Works:** When you select the "Journal" view, you see a calendar on the left and a writing area on the right. You can click on any date in the calendar to view, edit, or create an entry for that day. As you write, your entry is saved automatically. Any date on the calendar that has an entry will be marked with a small dot, giving you a visual overview of your journaling history.

### The DocuMind Workflow

This feature turns static documents into dynamic, interactive mind maps.

*   **Example Scenario:** You have a dense, 20-page research paper in PDF format that you need to understand for an exam.
*   **Your Action:** You select the "DocuMind" view and upload the PDF file.
*   **The Result:** Maven processes the document and generates a visual mind map. The paper's title becomes the central node. Major sections ("Introduction," "Methodology") become the main branches, and sub-headings become smaller branches connected to them.
*   **Interaction:** You can pan, zoom, and drag the nodes to reorganize the map. If you click on a specific node (e.g., "Data Analysis"), the AI Assistant sidebar will provide a concise explanation of that concept based on the information within your uploaded document.

### Google Workspace Integration Workflow

Securely bring in content from your Google Drive.

*   **Connecting Your Account:** You navigate to the "Workspace" view and click "Sign in with Google." You'll be prompted to grant Maven read-only permission for your Google Drive files. This is a secure process, and Maven can only view, not edit, your files.
*   **Importing a Document:** Once connected, you can search your Drive. You find a Google Doc named "Project Proposal" and click the "Import" button.
*   **The Result:** Maven instantly creates a new note in your Notes view titled "Imported: Project Proposal." The note's content is the full text of your Google Doc, with formatting preserved.

## 4. The AI Assistant: Your Central Command

The AI Assistant in the right sidebar is the most powerful way to use Maven. It understands natural language and can execute commands across the entire app using a technology called "function calling."

#### **Example Workflows:**

-   **Simple Task Management:** Instead of going to the Tasks widget, you can just type into the chat: *"add task to buy groceries"*. The AI understands this, uses the `addTask` function, and your task appears in the list. It then confirms, "✅ Task added: 'buy groceries'".

-   **Complex Event Scheduling:** You can give it a complex, natural-language command: *"schedule a meeting with the marketing team for next Tuesday at 3pm to discuss the Q4 launch"*. The AI will parse this, correctly calculate the date for "next Tuesday," and create a calendar event with the full title, correct date, and correct time.

-   **Advanced Content Creation:** You can chain commands: *"make a detailed plan for learning guitar and create a new note for it"*. The AI will first generate a structured plan (e.g., Week 1: Learn basic chords, Week 2: Practice strumming patterns). It will then use the `createNewNote` function to create a new note titled "Plan for learning guitar" and place the entire generated plan inside it.

## 5. Global AI Search (`Cmd+P`)

This feature lets you find information across *all* your notes instantly.

*   **Example Scenario:** You're writing a new note about marketing but can't remember a key statistic you wrote down a month ago in a note about "Project Phoenix."
*   **Your Action:** You press **`Cmd+P`** (or `Ctrl+P`). A search palette appears. You type: *"what was the engagement goal for Project Phoenix?"*
*   **The Result:** The AI reads all your notes in the background. It doesn't just find keywords; it understands the context. It then provides a direct, synthesized answer in the search palette: *"The goal for Project Phoenix was to increase user engagement by 15%."* Below this answer, it provides links to the 2-3 source notes it used to find this information, which you can click to jump directly to them.

## 6. Data & Privacy Management Workflow

Maven gives you full control over your data.

-   **The Backup Flow:** At any time, you can go to the Dashboard, navigate to **Settings**, and click **"Export All Data"**. This will download a single, human-readable JSON file to your computer containing everything—all your notes, tasks, habits, settings, etc.

-   **The Restore Flow:** If you get a new computer, you can open Maven, go to Settings, click **"Import Data,"** and select your backup file. The application will reload, and your entire workspace will be restored exactly as you left it.
-   **Wiping Data:** In the "Danger Zone" of the settings, you can choose to wipe all local data, securely deleting everything from your browser.
