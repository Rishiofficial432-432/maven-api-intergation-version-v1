# Comprehensive Market Research Prompt for Perplexity AI

**Persona:** Act as a senior market research analyst specializing in the SaaS, productivity software, and EdTech sectors.

**Context:** I am developing a new, highly integrated desktop application called "Maven." Your task is to conduct a thorough market analysis based on its core concept and features.

---

## **Application Overview: "Maven"**

Maven is an all-in-one, **privacy-first, local-first** intelligent workspace. Unlike cloud-based competitors like Notion, all user data (notes, tasks, etc.) is stored exclusively on the user's device, ensuring complete privacy and full offline functionality.

**Key Unique Selling Propositions (USPs):**

1.  **Local-First Architecture:** The primary differentiator. No cloud storage for personal data. This provides unparalleled privacy and data ownership.
2.  **True All-in-One Integration:** Combines over 15 distinct tools:
    *   **Core Productivity:** Rich-text notes, tasks, Kanban boards, calendar, journal.
    *   **AI-Powered Tools:** An AI assistant, a "Brain Dump" feature to parse unstructured text into actionable items, and a semantic search across all notes.
    *   **Unique Features:** A "DocuMind" tool to auto-generate interactive mind maps from documents (PDFs, DOCX) and a comprehensive **Academics Hub**.
3.  **Function-Driven AI:** The AI assistant (powered by Google Gemini) is a "do-engine." It uses function calling to reliably execute commands across the entire application (e.g., "schedule a meeting," "start a timer," "add a habit"), rather than just generating text.
4.  **Specialized Academics Hub:**
    *   **Student/Teacher Portal:** A real-time attendance system with secure check-ins (optional GPS verification to prevent cheating) and live dashboards.
    *   **AI Timetable Scheduler:** An automated tool for administrators to generate complex, conflict-free school timetables from Excel data.

## **Research Task & Specific Questions**

Please provide a detailed report addressing the following areas. Use headings and bullet points for clarity, and cite sources (articles, market reports, forum discussions) where possible.

### **1. Market Analysis & Trends**

*   What is the current market size and projected growth for the **Productivity Software** market and the **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** market?
*   What are the key trends driving these markets? Specifically, find evidence and discussions around:
    *   The growing demand for **privacy-focused and local-first software**.
    *   The integration of **Generative AI** into productivity workflows. What are the dominant AI implementation patterns (content generation vs. functional command execution)?
    *   The "all-in-one" vs. "best-of-breed" tool debate. Is there market fatigue from using too many separate apps?
*   What is the market size and key trends in the **Educational Technology (EdTech)** sector, specifically concerning classroom administration and scheduling tools?

### **2. Problem Validation**

*   Find evidence (articles, blog posts, forum discussions on Reddit, Hacker News, etc.) that validates the core problems Maven aims to solve:
    *   User concerns about the **privacy and data ownership of cloud-based tools like Notion**.
    *   The pain points of **"app fragmentation"** and context switching in modern workflows.
    *   The challenges and inefficiencies of **manual attendance tracking** in educational institutions.
    *   The complexity and difficulty of **manual academic timetable creation**.

### **3. Competitive Landscape**

*   **Cloud-Based All-in-Ones (e.g., Notion, Asana, ClickUp):**
    *   What are their primary strengths and weaknesses?
    *   How significant is Maven's **local-first/privacy-first** approach as a competitive advantage against them? What segment of their user base might be willing to switch for this feature?
*   **Local-First PKM Tools (e.g., Obsidian, Logseq, Anytype):**
    *   What are their strengths and weaknesses? They often appeal to a technical audience.
    *   How does Maven's "batteries-included," integrated, and more user-friendly approach compare? Is there a market for a less technical, more out-of-the-box local-first tool?
*   **Specialized EdTech Tools:**
    *   Identify key players in **student attendance systems** and **university timetabling software**.
    *   What is the value proposition of Maven's integrated Academics Hub versus these dedicated, standalone solutions?

### **4. Target Audience Analysis**

*   Provide detailed profiles for the following potential user segments:
    *   **The Privacy-Conscious Professional:** (e.g., lawyers, therapists, researchers handling sensitive data). What are their key needs and where do they look for software solutions?
    *   **The Power User / "Second Brain" Enthusiast:** How does Maven appeal to them compared to the hyper-customizable nature of Obsidian?
    *   **The Everyday Student:** What are their primary organizational challenges? Is the AI Daily Routine Planner a compelling feature?
    *   **The Educator / Administrator:** What are their biggest administrative pain points? How much influence do they have on institutional software purchasing decisions?

### **5. USP & Feature Evaluation**

*   Critically evaluate the strength of Maven's most novel features:
    *   **DocuMind (Document-to-Mind-Map):** How large is the market for mind-mapping tools? Is this automated generation a "killer feature" or a "nice-to-have"?
    *   **Function-Driven AI:** Is the concept of an AI "do-engine" a significant enough differentiator to attract users from tools that use AI primarily for content generation?
    *   **AI Timetable Scheduler:** How difficult is this problem for institutions? Is an automated solution a high-value proposition that institutions would pay for?

### **6. Potential Monetization & Go-to-Market Strategy**

*   Based on the local-first model, what are the most viable monetization strategies?
    *   One-time purchase?
    *   Optional subscription for premium features (e.g., end-to-end encrypted cloud sync)?
    *   Business/Institutional licenses for the Academics Hub?
*   What would be an effective go-to-market strategy to reach the identified target audiences? (e.g., content marketing on privacy, partnerships with universities, presence in PKM communities).
