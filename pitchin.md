# Maven: A Technical Pitch for the Future of Classroom Management & Student Engagement

**(Audience: Technical investors, institutional administrators, education department leaders)**

---

Good morning.

We're here today to talk about a fundamental inefficiency that plagues our educational institutions—a dual-sided problem that silently chips away at our most valuable resources: a teacher's time and a student's potential.

On one side, we have our educators, burdened by the daily, manual friction of administrative tasks. The most glaring example is attendance tracking—a process that is time-consuming, prone to error, and lacks integrity. This is time that could be spent teaching, mentoring, and inspiring.

On the other side, we have our students. Their days are often a fractured landscape of scheduled classes and unstructured free periods. This downtime, a significant portion of their campus life, is frequently underutilized. Without guidance or the right tools, it becomes a missed opportunity for personal development, academic reinforcement, and goal-oriented work.

This is not just an administrative issue; it's a pedagogical one. As educational philosophies, such as the recommendations in NEP 2020, evolve towards more personalized and experiential learning, the tools we use must evolve as well. We need a system that not only streamlines administration but also transforms unstructured time into an opportunity for growth.

That system is Maven.

Maven is not just another productivity app. It's a holistic educational operating system, and at its heart is the **Student/Teacher Portal**—a secure, real-time, and intelligent module designed to solve this dual problem head-on.

---

## Pillar 1: Reclaiming the Classroom - The Teacher's Experience

Our first objective is to eliminate the administrative friction that burdens educators. The Teacher Portal achieves this through a suite of integrated, intelligent features.

### Solving the Attendance Problem: A Secure, Automated, Real-Time Solution

The core of the problem is manual, insecure attendance. Our solution is a multi-layered, digital-first approach.

**The Workflow:**
1.  **Session Initiation:** A teacher starts class and, with a single click in their Maven dashboard, initiates a new attendance session.
2.  **Secure Check-in Code:** The system instantly generates a unique, time-sensitive 6-digit code and a corresponding QR code.
3.  **Real-Time Dashboard:** This is where the magic happens. On the teacher's screen, a live dashboard appears. As students check in using the code, their names populate the list in real-time. The teacher has an immediate, dynamic view of who is present, eliminating the need for roll calls or passing around a sheet.

This workflow directly addresses the expected outcome of a real-time attendance display. But we go further by solving the critical issue of academic integrity.

**Ensuring Integrity with Location-Aware Attendance:**
The most significant flaw in traditional systems is "buddy punching"—a student signing in for an absent friend. The Maven Portal solves this with an optional **Location-Aware (GPS) check-in**.

*   **How it Works:** When a teacher enables this feature, the session is geo-tagged with their current location. When a student attempts to check in, the app mandatorily requests their device's GPS coordinates.
*   **The Verification:** We use the **Haversine formula** client-side to calculate the great-circle distance between the teacher and the student. If the student is outside a predefined radius—say, 100 meters—the check-in is rejected, even if they have the correct code.
*   **The Result:** This makes it virtually impossible to cheat the system, ensuring the attendance record is a true and accurate reflection of physical presence. This directly fulfills the need for a secure, proximity-based verification system.

### From Data Collection to Actionable Insights

Automating attendance is only half the solution. The real value lies in what we do with the data.

*   **For Teachers & Counselors:** All attendance data is aggregated. A teacher can instantly view a student's attendance history, identifying patterns of absenteeism that may signal a need for intervention.
*   **For Administrators:** The portal provides high-level analytics, showing engagement rates across different classes or departments. This data is invaluable for institutional reporting and for developing targeted student support strategies. This empowers every stakeholder, from the teacher to the career counselor, with the data they need to foster student success.

---

## Pillar 2: Empowering the Student - From Free Time to Productive Time

For students, the portal is more than just a check-in tool. It’s the gateway to a personalized productivity ecosystem designed to help them manage their own development, especially during their free periods.

### A Seamless & Transparent Experience

*   **Instant Confirmation:** When a student checks in, they receive immediate confirmation. They can also view their complete attendance history at any time, eliminating disputes and fostering a sense of accountability.
*   **Integrated Daily Curriculum:** When a teacher starts a session, they can attach the day's curriculum topic and activities. This information is displayed to the student upon check-in, providing a clear agenda and helping absent students know what they missed.

### Transforming Free Periods with Personalized Tasks

This is where Maven moves beyond administration and into personal development. The app is designed to answer the question: "I have a free hour, what should I do?"

*   **Personalized Goal Setting:** A student uses Maven's dashboard to set their long-term academic and personal goals—"Complete research for history thesis," "Learn Python for data analysis," "Prepare for campus interviews."
*   **AI-Powered Daily Routine Generation:** The Maven AI Assistant can be prompted to generate a daily routine that intelligently combines the student's official class schedule with their long-term goals.
*   **Context-Aware Task Suggestions:** During a free period, the AI can proactively suggest personalized tasks. For example: *"You have a 90-minute break. This would be a good time to work on your goal 'Complete research for history thesis.' I can help you create a plan to outline the first chapter."*

This feature directly addresses the expected outcome of suggesting personalized academic tasks and generating a daily routine, turning Maven into a proactive partner in the student's education.

## The Technical Architecture: Secure, Scalable, and Minimalist

Our architecture is a hybrid model, designed to maximize both privacy and real-time functionality, while requiring minimal infrastructure from the institution.

*   **Core Application (The Student's Personal Space):** The student's notes, personal tasks, and journal entries remain **local-first**. We use `IndexedDB` and `localStorage` to ensure this data is private, secure, and always available offline.
*   **The Portal Module (The Institutional Layer):** For the real-time, multi-user functionality of the portal, we use **Supabase**, a scalable and secure backend-as-a-service platform.
    *   **Postgres Database:** For storing all relational data like user profiles, session information, and attendance records.
    *   **Supabase Auth:** To manage secure and distinct logins for students and teachers.
    *   **Real-Time Subscriptions:** This is the technology that powers the teacher's live attendance dashboard, pushing updates instantly from the database to the client.
*   **AI Integration:** The intelligence layer is powered by **Google's `gemini-2.5-flash` model**. We leverage its powerful function-calling capabilities to reliably translate natural language commands into actions within the app, whether it's a teacher using the **Curriculum Copilot** to generate a lesson plan or a student asking the AI to help structure their study time.

This hybrid architecture gives us the best of both worlds: uncompromising privacy for a student's personal workspace, and a robust, scalable, real-time infrastructure for the institutional features that require it.

## Conclusion: A New Educational Paradigm

Maven's Student/Teacher Portal is more than just an attendance tool. It is a comprehensive solution designed for the future of education.

By automating administrative tasks, we give teachers back their most valuable asset: time. By providing secure, verifiable attendance, we provide administrators with data they can trust. And by integrating personalized development tools, we empower students to take ownership of their education and turn every moment on campus into an opportunity for growth.

We are creating a more efficient, engaging, and data-driven learning environment for everyone. We are building the operational backbone for the modern educational institution.

Thank you.

# Maven: In-Depth Technical Explanations

This section provides a detailed, precise explanation of each feature within the Maven application, breaking down the core logic and algorithms that power them.

## The Dashboard & Core Widgets (Tasks, Kanban, etc.)

### 1. Concept & Purpose

The **Dashboard** is the user's daily command center. It's not a single feature but an aggregation of smaller, modular "widgets" that provide at-a-glance information and quick access to core functionalities. This includes **Tasks**, **Kanban Board**, **Calendar**, **Quick Notes**, **Habit Tracker**, and the **Personal Suite**.

### 2. Core Logic: CRUD and State Management

The underlying logic for most dashboard widgets is a classic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation model, managed locally within the user's browser.

**Data Structure (Example: Task):**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string; // Unique ID generated by crypto.randomUUID()
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
}
```

**Algorithm (Example: Toggling a Task):**
1.  **Event Trigger:** User clicks the checkbox next to a task item in the UI.
2.  **Identify Target:** The `onClick` handler receives the unique `id` of the task to be updated.
3.  **State Update:** The application's state management function (`setTasks`) is called. It iterates through the existing array of tasks.
    ```typescript
    setTasks(currentTasks => 
      currentTasks.map(task => 
        task.id === targetId 
          ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } // Found: return a new object with the 'completed' property flipped
          : task // Not found: return the original object
      )
    );
    ```
4.  **Persistence:** A `useEffect` hook listens for any changes to the `tasks` state. When a change is detected, it serializes the entire `tasks` array into a JSON string and saves it to the browser's `localStorage` under a key (e.g., `'maven-tasks'`).
5.  **UI Re-render:** React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state, showing the task as either checked or unchecked.

### 3. Why This Approach Works

-   **Performance:** All operations are performed in-memory and are lightning-fast. There are no network requests.
-   **Simplicity & Reliability:** CRUD is a time-tested and robust pattern for managing data collections.
-   **Offline First:** Because the data's source of truth is `localStorage`, the entire system works perfectly without an internet connection.

## AI Brain Dump Logic Explanation

### 1. Concept & Purpose

The **AI Brain Dump** is an intelligent parser designed to solve the problem of "chaotic input." It takes a user's unstructured, free-form text and transforms it into organized, actionable items within the Maven ecosystem.

### 2. Data Structure & Setup

-   **Input:** A single block of unstructured `string` from the user.
-   **Output:** A structured `JSON` object that categorizes the extracted information.

```typescript
interface BrainDumpResponse {
    tasks?: string[];
    events?: { title: string; date: string; time: string }[];
    quickNotes?: string[];
    newNotes?: { title: string; content?: string }[];
}
```

### 3. Algorithm Flow Summary

1.  **User Input:** The user provides text (e.g., *"remind me to call John tomorrow at 2pm, buy groceries, also I had a cool idea for a new blog post"*).
2.  **Prompt Engineering:** The system constructs a detailed prompt for the Gemini AI model. This prompt is crucial and contains:
    -   **Role Assignment:** "You are an automated text processing engine..."
    -   **Task Definition:** "...Your sole function is to extract actionable items and categorize them..."
    -   **Contextual Information:** The current date is injected to help the AI resolve relative terms like "tomorrow."
    -   **The User's Text:** The input string is embedded in the prompt.
    -   **Strict Output Formatting:** The prompt explicitly commands the AI to respond *only* with a JSON object that matches a specific schema.
3.  **Schema Definition:** A formal `responseSchema` is created that matches the `BrainDumpResponse` interface. This schema is sent to the Gemini API along with the prompt.
4.  **API Call:** A request is made to the `gemini-2.5-flash` model. The `config` object for this call specifies `responseMimeType: "application/json"` and includes the `responseSchema`. This forces the model to return a valid JSON object.
5.  **Response Parsing:** The returned JSON string is parsed into a `BrainDumpResponse` object.
6.  **User Verification UI:** The application UI displays the parsed items, grouped by category (Tasks, Events, etc.), each with a checkbox. This gives the user final control over what gets saved.
7.  **Action Dispatching:** When the user clicks "Save," the application iterates through the checked items and calls the appropriate internal functions (`onAddTask`, `onAddEvent`, etc.) to integrate them into the main app state.

### 4. Why This Approach Works

-   **Reliability:** Using a strict JSON schema with the Gemini API (`responseSchema`) dramatically increases the reliability of the output, preventing the AI from returning conversational text or malformed data.
-   **Efficiency:** It offloads the complex natural language processing (NLP) and entity recognition (identifying dates, times, and actions) to a powerful, pre-trained model.
-   **User Control:** The final verification step ensures the user is always in control, preventing the AI from adding unwanted items.

## Student/Teacher Portal & Attendance Logic

### 1. Concept & Purpose

The **Portal** is a secure, real-time system for managing classroom attendance. It solves the problems of manual tracking (inefficiency) and academic dishonesty ("buddy punching") by using a cloud backend and optional location verification.

### 2. Data Structure & Setup

The system relies on a **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) backend with three core tables:

```sql
-- Stores user profiles (both students and teachers)
CREATE TABLE portal_users (id uuid, name text, role text, ...);

-- Stores sessions created by teachers
CREATE TABLE portal_sessions (id uuid, teacher_id uuid, session_code text, is_active boolean, location jsonb, ...);

-- Logs each successful student check-in
CREATE TABLE portal_attendance (id bigint, student_id uuid, session_id uuid, ...);
```

### 3. Teacher Workflow: Starting a Session

1.  **User Action:** A teacher clicks "Start New Session."
2.  **Location Check (Optional):** If the "Location-Aware" toggle is enabled:
    -   The browser's `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` API is called.
    -   This prompts the teacher for location permission.
    -   On success, the teacher's `latitude` and `longitude` are captured.
3.  **Code Generation:** A unique 6-digit `session_code` is generated randomly. A 10-minute `expires_at` timestamp is calculated.
4.  **Database Insert:** An `INSERT` query is sent to the `portal_sessions` table, saving the `teacher_id`, `session_code`, `expires_at` timestamp, and the optional location data.
5.  **UI Update:** The teacher's dashboard updates to show the live session code, a QR code, and an empty list for live attendance.

### 4. Student Workflow: Checking In

1.  **User Action:** A student enters the 6-digit code and clicks "Check In."
2.  **Session Validation:** An API call is made to `SELECT` from `portal_sessions` where the `session_code` matches, `is_active` is `true`, and the current time is before `expires_at`. If no row is returned, an "Invalid Code" error is shown.
3.  **Location Verification (If Enforced):**
    -   The student's browser is prompted for location access.
    -   The student's `latitude` and `longitude` are retrieved.
    -   The **Haversine formula** is executed on the client to calculate the distance in meters between the student's coordinates and the teacher's coordinates (retrieved in the previous step).
    -   `if (distance > 100)` an error is shown ("You are too far from the class").
4.  **Attendance Logging:** An `INSERT` query is sent to the `portal_attendance` table with the `student_id` and the `session_id`.
    -   A `UNIQUE` constraint on `(student_id, session_id)` in the database prevents a student from checking in twice for the same session. If the insert fails due to this constraint, an "Already checked in" error is shown.
5.  **Confirmation:** If the insert is successful, the student's UI shows a "Checked In Successfully" message.

### 5. Real-Time Logic: The Live Dashboard

1.  **Subscription:** When the teacher's live session dashboard loads, it uses the Supabase client library to establish a **WebSocket connection** to the database.
2.  **Channel Listening:** The client subscribes to all `INSERT` events on the `portal_attendance` table, specifically filtered to the current `session_id`.
3.  **Live Update:** When a student successfully checks in (Step 4 above), the database insert triggers a message to be pushed over the WebSocket to the teacher's client. The client receives this new attendance record and dynamically adds the student's name to the live list, causing the UI to update in real-time without needing a refresh.

## Timetable Generation Logic Explanation

### 1. Data Structure & Setup

**Core Entities:** The system manages data from an Excel file, broken down into key entities:

```
Teachers (Name, Subjects[]) <-> Subjects (Name, HoursPerWeek) <-> Classes (Name, Subjects[], StudentCount) <-> Rooms (Name, Capacity)
```

**Input Structure (from Excel):**
-   **Teachers Sheet:** Rows with `TeacherName`, `SubjectsTaught` (comma-separated).
-   **Subjects Sheet:** Rows with `SubjectName`, `HoursPerWeek`.
-   **Classes Sheet:** Rows with `ClassName`, `Subjects` (comma-separated), `StudentCount`.
-   **Rooms (from UI):** A simple list of rooms and their seating capacity.

### 2. Scheduling Request Generation

**Step 1: Create All Required Sessions**
The system first flattens the input data into a list of every single class period that needs to be scheduled for the week.

```
// Pseudocode
sessionsToSchedule = [];
for each Class in Classes:
  for each SubjectName in Class.subjects:
    hours = getHoursForSubject(SubjectName);
    for i from 1 to hours:
      sessionsToSchedule.push({ className: Class.name, subjectName: SubjectName });
```
This creates a master list of all ~500 individual periods that must be placed in the timetable.

### 3. Conflict Prevention System (The Core Algorithm)

The algorithm uses a **greedy, constraint-satisfaction approach**. It iterates through each session and tries to find the first available valid slot, preventing conflicts by design.

**Real-Time Tracking Maps:** Three key data structures track resource availability in real-time.

```typescript
// Maps a resource name to a schedule grid (Day -> Set of occupied TimeSlots)
teacherSchedule: Map<TeacherName, Map<Day, Set<TimeSlot>>>
roomSchedule: Map<RoomName, Map<Day, Set<TimeSlot>>>
classSchedule: Map<ClassName, Map<Day, Set<TimeSlot>>>
```

**The Main Loop:**
```
// Pseudocode
for each Session in sessionsToSchedule:
  isPlaced = false;
  for each Day in Weekdays:
    for each TimeSlot in TimeSlots:
      // 1. Check Class Availability
      if classSchedule[Session.className][Day].has(TimeSlot):
        continue; // Class is busy, try next slot

      // 2. Find Available Teacher
      availableTeacher = findTeacherFor(Session.subjectName, Day, TimeSlot);
      if (!availableTeacher):
        continue; // No teacher available, try next slot

      // 3. Find Available Room
      availableRoom = findRoomFor(Session.studentCount, Day, TimeSlot);
      if (!availableRoom):
        continue; // No room available, try next slot

      // 4. SUCCESS: A valid slot is found. Book it.
      bookSlot(Session, Day, TimeSlot, availableTeacher, availableRoom);
      isPlaced = true;
      break; // Move to next Session
    if (isPlaced) break;
  if (isPlaced) break;

  if (!isPlaced):
    // Could not place this session, report an error.
    throw new Error("Could not schedule " + Session.subjectName + " for " + Session.className);
```

### 4. Booking and Validation

**Booking Process:** The `bookSlot` function updates the three tracking maps.
```typescript
function bookSlot(Session, Day, TimeSlot, Teacher, Room):
  // Mark resources as occupied for this specific day and time
  teacherSchedule[Teacher.name][Day].add(TimeSlot);
  roomSchedule[Room.name][Day].add(TimeSlot);
  classSchedule[Session.className][Day].add(TimeSlot);

  // Add the entry to the final timetable result
  finalTimetable.push({ day: Day, timeSlot: TimeSlot, ... });
```

**Validation:** Because the algorithm checks for conflicts *before* every booking, the final generated schedule is guaranteed to be conflict-free. An error is thrown during generation if a valid slot cannot be found for any required session.

### 5. Why This Approach Works

-   **Deterministic:** It's a pure algorithm, not AI-based, so it will produce the same result every time for the same input.
-   **Conflict-Free by Design:** The use of real-time tracking maps makes it impossible to double-book a teacher, class, or room.
-   **Efficient:** The greedy approach is computationally efficient and well-suited to run inside a Web Worker without freezing the user's browser.

## Other Features: A Quick Logic Overview

-   **DocuMind:** Uses a parsing algorithm to convert indented text into a tree data structure (`{ id, text, children: [] }`). It then uses a **radial layout algorithm** to calculate the (x, y) coordinates for each node, arranging them in circles and arcs to prevent overlap.
-   **Daily Routine:** A pure AI-driven feature. It constructs a detailed prompt for Gemini, providing the user's fixed calendar events and long-term goals as context, and asks the AI to act as a productivity coach to fill in the gaps.
-   **Google Workspace:** Uses the official Google Identity Services (GSI) library for a secure OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. It then makes authenticated API calls to the Google Drive API to search for files and export their content as HTML.
-   **Settings, Help & Guide:** These are static content views for user configuration and information. The data management logic in Settings uses `JSON.stringify` to export all local data into a downloadable file and `JSON.parse` to import it back.
-   **Analytics & Personal:** These dashboard widgets are primarily read-only views that aggregate and display data already stored in other modules (e.g., counting completed tasks, summarizing expenses).
